# Zappos-Code-Challenge
My submission for Zappos Code Challenge 2017, placing me 3rd.

The challenge was to program a solution for a path-finding game. These puzzles are similar to the puzzles found on apps like Flow: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow&hl=en

Winners were determined by who submitted a solution first that could solve the provided twenty puzzles. I ended up placing 3rd out of sixty high school and college students, among them people studying for graduate degrees in CS. I submitted my solution on March 1, 2017.

My code is very mediocre and not well-documented nor very efficient; I was trying to find a solution as fast as possible and was not going for elegance.
